NOW:

1) check functionality of JT's driver. Seems just to satisfy needs of SNY-OBS
!!! JT seems not to distinguish single ended and differential mode
!!! He sets number of channels to 8 (which would be single ended)
!!! but SNY-OBS uses 4 differential channels
    He might have intended diff. mode but forgot to change the number when
    changing symbol CH_NUMBER_DIFF to CH_NUMBER in JT/06*

2) adapt package_desc
3) check/adapt tools, maybe remove them if m36 tools can be used
4) check/adapt example, maybe remove them if m36 tools can be used



LATER:

*!*!*!*!*!*!*!* THIS LOOKS WRONG *!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!*!* POSSIBLE ERROR *!*!*!*!*
DRIVERS/MDIS_LL/M037/TOOLS/M37_BLKWRITE/COM/m37_blkwrite.c contains M36_EXT_TRIG
                ^^^^                                                ^^^
                  37                      <-->                       36
There is also a M37_EXT_TRIG in m37_drv.h


M36_drv.c top-comment:
 *               The M36 module is a 16 bit analog input module with 8
 *               grounded or 16 differential inputs. This depends on the input
It's vice versa:
  16 grounded or 8 differential inputs.


MAYBE:

If there are problems with channel initialisation, try if this helps (see 29efa48):
       u_int32 tmp;
#define ADC_REF_CTRL 0x9c
#if 0
       /* Enable ADC */
    DBGWRT_1((DBH, "JT - Enable ADC\n"));
       MWRITE_D32(llHdl->ma, ADC_REF_CTRL, 0x2c);
       tmp = MREAD_D32(llHdl->ma, ADC_REF_CTRL);
       DBGWRT_1((DBH, "JT 0x9c = 0x%x\n", tmp));
